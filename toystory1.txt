{{TD||(''Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house. Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting into the van. Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|*to the mutant toys* We gotta run, thanks, guys!}}
{{TD||(''With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint toward the fence.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Quick!}}
{{TD||(''Woody slips through the slats in the fence, but Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck. Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before realizing that Buzz is missing. He looks back to discover Buzz stuck in the fence.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Just go, I'll catch up!}}
{{TD||(''Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz. The van begins pulling out of the driveway. Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the fence. The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the van driving off down the street. Woody and Buzz turn around. The moving van drives right over them. Woody and Buzz scream, ducking just in time. After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few steps behind.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Come on!}}
{{TD||(''Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the moving truck. Scud bears his teeth and growls. Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few paces. A strap dangles off the back of the truck. Buzz makes a leap for it and grabs hold. He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper. Woody then lunges for the strap, but it stays just out of reach.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|You can do it, Woody!}}
{{TD||(''Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Whoo-hoo-hoo! I made it.}}
{{TD||(''Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale. Woody looks behind him to see Scud. The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|*kicking Scud with other foot* Aaaah! Aah! Get away, you stupid dog! Down, down! Aah, aah!}}
{{TD||(''Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Hold on, Woody!}}
{{TD|Woody|I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!}}
{{TD|Buzz|NOOOOOOO!!}}
{{TD||(''Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout. He angrily grabs Scud's eyelids and furiously snaps them hard. Scud yelps, letting go of Woody. The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his face.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Buzz!}}
{{TD||(''The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and Scud behind. Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the bumper. He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door. Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light. Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking Woody with it. Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what he's looking for. A pile of moving boxes with the words "ANDY'S TOYS" written on them in crayon. Scud flings Buzz off his face. Buzz goes tumbling under a parked car. Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to get under it. Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes. All the toys wince and moan as they cover their eyes from the sudden brightness.'')}}
{{TD|Slinky|Ow!}}
{{TD|Rex|Are we there already?}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|Woody?!}}
{{TD|Rex|Woody!}}
{{TD|Slinky|How did you-}}
{{TD|Hamm|How'd he get here?}}
{{TD|Slinky|Where have you- What happened?}}
{{TD||(''Strange, Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin rummaging through the next box. Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys grumble in confusion as they poke their heads up out of the first box.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Ow!}}
{{TD|Hamm|What's goin' on? What's he taken?}}
{{TD|Woody|Aha! There you are! *pulls the RC Car and the remote out of the second box*}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|Hey. What's he doing?}}
{{TD||(''Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the RC Car out onto the street. The other toys scream in horror.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Aah! He's at it again!}}
{{TD||(''Woody turns on the remote and steers the RC car past Scud and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding. RC's motor whirrs at the sight of Buzz. The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to cross the intersection.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|GET HIM!!!}}
{{TD||(''All the toys pour out of their boxes and charge on Woody.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Roar!}}
{{TD|Woody|Ah-ah! No, no!}}
{{TD||(''Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid the angry mob of toys. Buzz jumps on to the RC car and they zoom back toward the moving truck. Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on Buzz. Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|No, no, no, no! Wait! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!}}
{{TD||(''The RC car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts doing doughnuts matching Woody's in the middle of the street.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!}}
{{TD|Woody|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!}}
{{TD||(''Rocky throws Woody to the floor. RC resumes his course straight down the street with Scud giving close chase. Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody.'')}}
{{TD|Hamm|Pig pile!}}
{{TD||(''The RC car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off. Buzz manages to land back on RC, but facing backwards. It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes. Buzz, on seeing this, screams as he and the RC car drive straight into it. Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a halt just missing a car. The car swerves and crashes into another car. Soon there is a multi-car pileup that encircles Scud, entrapping the dog.'')}}
{{TD|Driver #1|Get outta that car!}}
{{TD|Driver #2|Move it!}}
{{TD|Buzz|Whew.}}
{{TD||(''Buzz and the RC car emerge from the intersection safely on the other side. The mob of toys lift up Woody still holding the remote and head for the open back.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there, we've gotta help him!}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|Toss him overboard!}}
{{TD|Woody|No, no, no, wait! Aah!}}
{{TD||(''The toys toss him out into the road. As the truck drives off, the toys cheer.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Hooray!}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|So long Woody!}}
{{TD||(''Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes over him. Woody tries to get up again when Buzz and RC come barreling toward him.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Ohh! Woody!}}
{{TD||(''The RC Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving. Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz still holding the remote.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Whoa! Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.}}
{{TD|Buzz|Look out!}}
{{TD||(''The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car that had passed over Woody earlier. Woody screams and gives the steering wheel on the remote a hard left, missing the tire by inches. The RC Car moves up under the car.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Now let's catch up to that truck!}}
{{TD||(''Woody flicks a switch from "on" to "turbo". The RC Car speeds up toward the moving truck. The toys are busy congratulating one another when Lenny, the wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and Woody.'')}}
{{TD|Lenny|Guys, guys, Woody's riding RC!}}
{{TD|Bo Peep|What?!}}
{{TD|Lenny|And Buzz is with him!}}
{{TD||(''The toys rush to the edge of the open truck. Bo picks up Lenny and looks through him.'')}}
{{TD|Bo Peep|It ''is'' Buzz! Woody was telling the truth!}}
{{TD|Slinky Dog|What have we done!?}}
{{TD|Rex|Great, now I have guilt.}}
{{TD||(''The RC Car begins to gain on the truck.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|We're almost there!}}
{{TD|Bo Peep|Rocky, the ramp!}}
{{TD||(''Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side of the back. Rocky pushes down hard on the lever. The ramp begins to lower. Woody and Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down right on top of them.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Look out!}}
{{TD||(''The RC Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into the road. Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the pavement.'')}}
{{TD|Slinky|Quick, hold on to my tail!}}
{{TD||(''Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp. Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody. Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab Slinky's hand. They grab hold of one another.'')}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|Atta boy, Slink!}}
{{TD||(''All of a sudden, the RC Car begins to slow down pulling Slinky's front end off the ramp. His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch.'')}}
{{TD|Slinky|Ohh, Woody! Woody, speed up!}}
{{TD|Woody|Speed up!}}
{{TD|Buzz|The batteries! They're running out!}}
{{TD|Slinky|Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!}}
{{TD||(''RC's headlight eyes sag. The car slows even more. As Slinky continues stretching. The RC Car begins to weave side-to-side like a water skier. With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her sideview mirror.'')}}
{{TD|Radio|<poem><i>Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase</i></poem>}}
{{TD||(''The RC Car is with Woody and Buzz as it weaves into view and then back out. With Slinky's midsection stretched to the limit, he begins to lose his grip on Woody.'')}}
{{TD|Slinky|I can't hold on much longer!}}
{{TD|Woody|Slink, hang on!}}
{{TD||(''Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into the moving truck and knocking over all the toys. The RC Car sputters to a stop. Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving truck disappear. Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Great!}}
{{TD||(''Buzz tries to look back, but "The Big One" is in his sight's way. He gets an idea.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Woody, the rocket!}}
{{TD|Woody|The match! Yes! Thank you, Sid!}}
{{TD||(''Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put there earlier. Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against RC's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when A car whizzes right over them, blowing out the match. Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|No, no, no, no!! No! Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!}}
{{TD||(''Buzz bows his head, causing his helmet to block the sun from Woody. As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody looks at his hand. A white hot dot like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears on the back of Woody's hand. Looking up, he sees it's being caused by Buzz's helmet. Smiling, Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Woody, what are you doing?!}}
{{TD|Woody|Hold still, Buzz!}}
{{TD||(''The fuse lights.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Ha-ha! *jumps back onto the car*}}
{{TD|Buzz|You did it! Next stop: Andy!}}
{{TD|Woody|Wait a minute... I just lit a rocket. ''Rockets explode!''}}
{{TD||(''With an unprecedented force, the RC Car rockets forward. Speeding along the dividing line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the moving truck can be seen on the horizon. The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out on the floor.'')}}
{{TD|Slinky|I should've held on longer...}}
{{TD|Lenny|*looks out the back again* Look, look, it's Woody and Buzz comin' up fast!}}
{{TD||(''The toys run to the opening and cheer.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Woody!}}
{{TD||(''The rocket's velocity becomes so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and Woody off the RC Car. Woody manages to continue holding onto RC, but not for long. Woody is forced to let go of the RC Car. They separate, sending the two toys upward and RC into the back of the truck. The toys cheering turns into screaming as they rush to get out of the way of the oncoming RC rocket.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Ah! Take cover!}}
{{TD||(''RC smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying. The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|AAAH!! This is the part where we blow up!}}
{{TD|Buzz|Not today!}}
{{TD||(''Buzz presses the button on his chest. A familiar pair of wings jut out of Buzz, severing the now weakened tape that holds him to rocket. The toys separate from the rocket just before it blows up. The toys plummet.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|*covering his eyes* ''AAAHH!!!''}}
{{TD||(''Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward again. Woody takes a peek.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!}}
{{TD|Buzz|This isn't flying. This is falling with style!}}
{{TD|Woody|Ha-ha-ha!! To infinity and beyooond!}}
{{TD||(''They soar gracefully toward the moving truck, but then pass over it.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|*confused* Uh, Buzz! We missed the truck!}}
{{TD|Buzz|We're not aiming for the truck!}}
{{TD||(''Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then drop into the car. Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box in the back seat right next to Andy. Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the box.'')}}
{{TD|Andy|*happily* Hey, wow!}}
{{TD|Mrs. Davis|What? What is it?}}
{{TD|Andy|*picking up the toys* Woody! Buzz!}}
{{TD|Mrs. Davis|Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?}}
{{TD|Andy|Here in the car!}}
{{TD|Mrs. Davis|See? Now what did I tell you? Right where you left them.}}
{{TD||(''Andy hugs both toys. They give each other a knowing wink.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Ext. Andy's New House]}}
{{TD||(''Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents.'')}}
{{TD|Andy|Which one can I open first?}}
{{TD|Mrs. Davis|Let's let Molly open one.}}
{{TD||(''One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal Sarge. The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his binoculars. He turns and motions back into the tree. A baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported by several green army men. One of the soldiers turns it on.'')}}
{{TD||[Trans. Int. Andy's new room]}}
{{TD||(''The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand. Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the nightstand alongside the monitor. They listen intently.'')}}
{{TD|Sarge|*o.s., over monitor* Frankincense, this is Myrrh. Come in, Frankincense.}}
{{TD|Hamm|Hey, heads up everybody, it's showtime.}}
{{TD|Rex|Oh, it's time!}}
{{TD||(''Woody and the rest of the toys are mingling together like a typical office Christmas party. The toys all stop and run toward the monitor. Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to reveal Bo Peep.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Woah! Oh, Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.}}
{{TD|Bo Peep|Merry Christmas, Sheriff.}}
{{TD||(''She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched on a shelf dangling mistletoe.'')}}
{{TD|Woody|Say, isn't that mistletoe?}}
{{TD|Bo Peep|Mm-hm.}}
{{TD||(''Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and kisses him. The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor restless with excitement not fear.'')}}
{{TD|Rex|Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater. That way I could play the, uh, dominant predator. Ha-ha-ha!}}
{{TD|Buzz|Quiet everyone, quiet!}}
{{TD|Sarge|*o.s., over monitor* Molly's first present is... Mrs. Potato Head, repeat. A Mrs. Potato Head!}}
{{TD|Hamm|Way to go, Idaho!}}
{{TD|Mr. Potato Head|Gee, I better shave.}}
{{TD||(''Potato Head whips off his moustache piece. Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz. Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.'')}}

{{TD|Buzz|Me? No, no. Pfft. No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.}}
{{TD|Sarge|*o.s., over monitor*  Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now opening his first present- I can't make quite out- A large box- it's- it-}}
{{TD||(''The monitor turns to static.'')}}
{{TD|Buzz|Are you?}}
{{TD|Woody|Ha! Now, Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?}}
{{TD||(''The camera zooms out through the window.'')}}
{{TD|Andy|*o.s.* Oh, what is it? What is it? Wow, a puppy!}}
{{TD||(''The camera zooms back through the window to a close up of Woody and Buzz. They look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and laugh weakly. As the credits begin to roll, "You've Got a Friend in Me (Duet)" plays. After the credits, Disney logo is closing and Pixar logo is closing too.'')}}
